Important mentions from config file

directConnect:true – Removes the need to start a selenium server and run the tests directly on the browser.
    This saves the need to start a selenium server each time tests have to be executed.

‘shardTestFiles’: true – with this option, the browser starts a new instance after each test (the cache/passwords/previous
    options will be deleted before the each execution). This saved our project a lot of headaches due to weird interactions
       between saved password/ saved logins and pages not refreshing when getting to the next test suite.
       It’s highly recommended to use this option because each new test case will run independently from the last one.

‘maxInstances’: 1, – set how many test will be executed in parallel, this option works locally and on the CI as well.
    Should stick to two or three because this will take a lot of computing power if more than that will be picked.
